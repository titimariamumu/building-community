Agua Dulce is a volunteer-run participatory art project. We use art and the internet to collaboratively process news media.
Agua Dulce is the Spanish word freshwater, when directed translated it means - sweet water. Like aguadulce, the goal of this project is
to be refreshing and life-giving to those overwhelmed by  

- the fast pace of the 24-hour news cycle
- the sheer size of the growing news media pool
- biases
- misinformation
- traumatic information
- what they don't yet understand. 

  Agua Dulce 1.0 will run bi-weekly Summer 2024.
